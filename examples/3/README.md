## Run Locally

(First [install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install))

If you do not have this repo on your computer yet, run these commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdamoc/elm-new-achitecture.git
cd elm-new-achitecture
```

Once you are in the `elm-new-achitecture/` directory, run these commands:

```bash
cd examples/3/
elm-reactor
```

And then open [http://localhost:8000/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/Main.elm) to see it in action!
